I’m Xizhi Xiao, a sophomore at Peking University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I joined the [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/) (an AGI program founded by [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/)), being a member and the monitor in the class of 2021.
I’m interested in cognitive reasoning and machine learning. In 2022 summer, I researched on social intelligence in nonverbal signals via physically grounded simulation under the guidance of [Prof. Yujia Peng](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/professor/yujiapeng/index.htm) and [Dr. Lifeng Fan](https://lifengfan.github.io/) at [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://bigai.ai/).
In my spare time, I love dancing, baking and watching documentaries. These hobbies give me an opportunity to relax thoroughly, explore heartily and create freely.
