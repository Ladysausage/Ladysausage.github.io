I’m [Xizhi Xiao](https://ladysausage.github.io), a junior undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in artificial intelligence. I joined the [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn) (an AGI program founded by Prof. [Song-Chun Zhu](https://zhusongchun.net)), being a member and the monitor in the class of 2021. I’m also affiliated with the [PKU Cognitive Reasoning Lab](https://pku.ai) and a research intern at the [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://eng.bigai.ai/about/). I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yixin Zhu](https://yzhu.io), Dr. [Lifeng Fan](https://lifengfan.github.io), and Prof. [Song-Chun Zhu](https://zhusongchun.net).

I have broad interests in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, social psychology, and neuroscience. My research focuses on exploring the underlying mechanism of human social cognition and engineering machine social intelligence to build socially intelligent systems that can interact with humans safely. Presently, I focus on modeling normative concepts such as ownership and morality.

Outside of science, I enjoy [dancing](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2vlgt2lz7W9rPTvzDDsD0A), baking, and watching movies and documentaries.
